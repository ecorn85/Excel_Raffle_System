# Excel_Lottery_System

## Purpose
With streamers taking donations for suggestions/nicknames, the purpose of this project is to give them a way to:
  1. Keep an organized list of entries.
  2. Use a randomized lottery selection.
  3. Keep track of what entries have already been used.
  4. The ability to expand up/create new worksheets while still maintaining functionality.
  
## Implementation
The workbook uses Excel's Visual Basic functionality to manipulate cells. It also uses Excel's built-in formulas and conditional formatting.

The code can be accessed by pressing "Alt + F11."

## How it works

### Overview
Each row acts as its own lottery pool. The count column keeps track of the number of filled cells within the pool. Clicking on the selector will look at the pool, look for unused entries, and select one at random. The selected entry is displayed to the right of the selection cell, and the entry is highlighted in yellow to indicate it has been used.

For easy cleanup, double-clicking the big red button will clear all entries out of all pools.

**Feel free to add/remove rows. The code is designed to scale with the number of rows.**

**Do not add/remove columns unless you are prepared to edit the code/formatting.**
